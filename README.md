# PyBer_Analysis

Project Overiview 
The PyBer Analysis project is aimed at looking at a data set of information of a ride-sharing company. The project entails creating a summary of the ride sharing data given and sorting them by the 3 different city types; Urban, Rural and Suburban. From the analysis, a visual will be created to further display the information on how the data differs by city type and aid decision making for the stakeholders at PyBer.

Results 
The analysis of the data from the different cities shows that the rural users have the lowest numbers (i.e lowest number of rides, drivers and total fares) while the urban cities have the highest number of rides, drivers and total fares. Although the total rides and number of drivers for the rural cities were the least, they had a significantly higher average fare per ride cost and average fare per driver cost in comparison to the other 2 city types. 
The urban cities, however, had a significantly higher total fares in comparison to the otehr city types. 


Summary 
The following are recoomendations to PyBer on ways to address the disparity among the city types:
- The base fare(which affectcs the average fare per ride) can be slightly increased for the rural and suburban users in order to increase the total fare collected for both city types. 
- There can be incetives in the rural area to increase the demand and so increase the number in total. An increae in the number of total rides will lead to an increase in the total fare collected.
- There can be incentives for drivers in order to get more drivers in areas that are lacking.
